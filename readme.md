# c_practice

Here's an assortment of different simple programs to serve as a cookbook for c syntax for various concepts. Each practice project has its own folder and main.c program (in addition to other files)

## helloworld

A good starting program for any language.

## greeter

A program that receives an argument either by command line or stdin (for piping in the unix shell).

### structs

A program that demonstrates structs, enums, fake constructors, and a function accepting a struct as its first argument to behave as a fake method.
